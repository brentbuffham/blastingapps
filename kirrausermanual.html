                <b>Supported file types:</b><br><br>

                Current <b>Kirra Blasting App</b> supports several file types and structures. <b>Kirra</b> can accept what are known as human readable "flat files".
                These types of files are used commonly in the blasting industry to transport a multitude of different sets of data from one program to another.
                Almost all programs used in mining can accept files that have values separated by commas or tabs. The files that <b>Kirra</b> uses are the similar.<br><br>
                As are the files that <b>Kirra</b> can export.
                <br><br>
                However the files must consist of a fixed structure depending on their purpose. The drawing files are fixed and may be confusing to generate manually.
                <br><br>
                The holes files are also fixed to various column numbers and the data must be in the correct columns. The data must also be in the correct format.
                The best results come from ensuring the file is formatted correctly.
                <br><br>

                <b>Files types supported by Kirra are as follows:</b><br><br>

                <u>Text files (.txt)</u> - These are still comma separated value files however they use the .txt suffix to denote drawing.<br>
                <ul>
                    <li><i>These files are used to store <b>drawing</b> data in a human readable format.</i></li>
                    <li><i>The files are still comma separated value files however they use the .txt suffix to denote drawing.</i></li>
                    <li><i>They can be opened in any text editor and can be edited manually.</i></li>
                    <li><i>They can also be opened in Excel and other spreadsheet programs.</i></li>
                </ul>
                <u>Comma Separate Values (.csv)</u> - These are comma separated value files.<br>
                <ul>
                    <li><i>These files are used to store <b>hole</b> and <b>point</b> data in a human readable format.</i></li>
                    <li><i>They can be opened in any text editor and can be edited manually.</i></li>
                    <li><i>They can also be opened in Excel and other spreadsheet programs.</i></li>
                </ul>
                <u>Kirra Drawing (.kad)</u> - These are comma separated value files however they use the .kad suffix<br>
                <ul>
                    <li><i>These .kad files are <b>ONLY</b> usable in the desktop application.</i></li>
                    <li><i>They files are used to store <b>drawing</b> data in a human readable format.</i></li>
                    <li><i>They can be opened in any text editor and can be edited manually.</i></li>
                    <li><i>Use the .txt format for drawing files if you wish to use the application on iPad or iPhone.</i></li>

                        section is where you can alter the connection or surface ties of a blast. Currently there are two option.<br><br>
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                <u>Tie-in one by one</u> This mode is a single tie-in mode. It will only allow you to tie-in one blast hole at a time.
                                This is useful for tying in a blast hole that is not in the correct position.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <u>Tie-in all in a line</u> This mode is a multiple tie-in mode. It will allow you to tie-in all blast holes in a line.
                                This is useful for tying in a group of blast holes that are with in the tolerance of the "Connect Distance".
                                The default amout is 1.0 meters. This is the distance that the blast holes can be out of alignment and still be connected.
                                To increase or decrease adjust the slider.
                            </li>
                        </ol>

                        <u>Delay</u> amount text field is used to adjust the amount of time in milliseconds that the blast holes will be delayed by.
                        The default is 25 milliseconds. This value can be any valid integer, both positive and negative. There is no product supplier specific range.
                        Feel free to experiment with times that suit your needs and your desired blast results. However, in practicality nonel is restrictive in its range of delays.
                        <i>Those being 0ms(black), 9ms(purple/green), 17ms(yellow), 25ms(red), 42ms(white), 65ms(blue), 67ms(blue), 100ms(orange), 109ms(black), 125ms(cream) and a few more higher values.</i>
                        <br><br>
                        <u>Colour</u> button is located adjacent to the "Delay" text field. Clicking this button will open a colour picker. Select a colour to assign to the "Connector" you will be connceting with.
                        <br><br>
                        <u>Connect Distance</u> is a slider that is used to determine the distance that the blast holes can be out of alignment and still be connected. The range is 0.1 meters to 20.0 meters.
                        Use this is to adjust the connection tolerance on larger or titghter patterns. Generally speaking, blasts in the designs stage can be easily connected using the default value of 1.0 meters.
                        However if you are connecting a blast based on actual blast hole placement, you may need to adjust this value to get the desired result.
                        <br><br>
                        <b><u>Important!</u></b> there is no undo function for this at the moment. If you make a mistake just reconnect the connector you wanted.
                        A blast hole can only have one connector arrow, the arrow heads represent the detonator end of the connector. Yo can have many tails but ONLY one Arrow head per hole. Connecting a different hole means you overwrite the old connector.

                        is a simple function. Use this to watch the firing sequence play. This is <b>NOT</b> real time, it is only an animation for determining out of sequence blast holes.
                        You can speed the animation up or make it slower to determing the specific hole. "PLAY" plays the animation and "STOP" stops and resets the animation. The "Slider" adjusts the speed of the playback.

                        You can adjust the millisecond binning window by adjustin the slider. You can also interact with the chart and select individual or groups of binned blast holes.
                        The chart is interactive and will display the number of holes in the bin. Their names and the blast they belong to are displayed in the chart. Blast holes will also be highlighted in the canvas.

                        <u>Drawing Tools</u>
                        are a various group of functions that add annotations to your blast these are all avaiable to be exported to a file.
                        The drawings are seperate from the holes. Holes an drawings cannot be in the same file at this stage. There are a range of different drawing tools and whilst they are in 2D canvas space only (currently).
                        These tools are all capable of drawing in 3D coordinate spaces. This is facilitated by the "Elevation" input field. The elevation field assigns the Z value of the point/linepoint .etc that you are drawing.<br><br>

                        <u>Elevation (Z)</u> is the input field that is used to assign the Z value of the point/linepoint .etc that you are drawing.
                        The value is in meters and can be any valid number, both positive and negative. There is no product supplier specific range.
                        <br><br>
                        <u>Colour</u> chooser is located below the "Elevation" input field. Clicking this button will open a colour picker.
                        Select a colour to assign to the "Drawing" you will be drawing with.
                        <br><br>
                        <u>Point Drawing</u> switch the tool to active, indicated by a green highlight, you are now in the drawing point mode.
                        This tool draws a a simple point at the X and Y coordinates that you click on in the canvas. The Z value is the elevation value that you enter in the "Elevation" input field.
                        <br><br>
                        <u>Line Drawing</u> switch the tool to active, indicated by a green highlight, you are now in the drawing line mode.
                        This tool draws a a simple line from the last point that you clicked on in the canvas to the next point that you click on in the canvas. The Z value is the elevation value that you enter in the "Elevation" input field.
                        <br><br>
                        <u>Polygon Drawing</u> switch the tool to active, indicated by a green highlight, you are now in the drawing polygon mode.
                        This tool draws a a simple polygon from the last point that you clicked on in the canvas to the next point that you click on in the canvas. The Z value is the elevation value that you enter in the "Elevation" input field.
                        <br><br>
                        <u>Circle Drawing</u> switch the tool to active, indicated by a green highlight, you are now in the drawing circle mode.
                        This tool draws a circle at the X, Y and Elevation with the radius indicated by the <u>Radius(m)</u> input field on point that you click on in the canvas.
                        <br><br>
                        <u>Text Drawing</u> switch the tool to active, indicated by a green highlight, you are now in the drawing text mode.
                        This tool draws a text at the X, Y and Elevation with the text indicated by the <u>Text</u> input field on point that you click on in the canvas.
                        The text tool also has an evaluation function that allows you to enter a formula that will be evaluated and the result will be displayed as the text.
                        It also allows you to create line breaks in the text by using the "\n" character. This is useful for creating multi-line text. You can also use any Javascript function in the formula.
                        <br><br>
                        <u>For example:</u> <br><br>
                        If you want to calculate the mass of a blast hole's charge you can use the following formula:<br><br>
                        <i>=Math.round(Math.PI * Math.pow((diametermm/2),2) * chargelength/1000 * density)</i><br><br>
                        Replace the "diametermm", "chargelength" and "density" with the values that you want to use. The formula will be evaluated and the result will be displayed as the text.
                        <br><br>
                        If you want to calculate the rock volume a blast hole will influence you can use the following formula:<br><br>
                        <i>=burden * spacing * benchheight</i><br><br>
                        Replace the "burden", "spacing" and 'benchheight" with the values that you want to use. The formula will be evaluated and the result will be displayed as the text.<br>
                        You can then use the result of the two calcualted formulas to calculate the powder factor of the blast hole:<br><br>
                        <i>= mass / rockvolume</i><br><br>
                        Replace the "mass" with formula 1 result and the "rockvolume" with formula 2 result. The formula will be evaluated and the result will be displayed as the text.
                        <br><br>
                        If you want to create multi-line text you can use the following formula:<br><br>
                        <i>Text1\nText2\nText3</i><br><br>
                        Replace the "Text1", "Text2" and "Text3" with the values that you want to use. The formula will be evaluated and the result will be displayed as the text.
                        <br><br>
                        <u>To enter a complex formula try pasting the option below into the text input field</u>, the result will be displayed as calculated text:<br><br>
                        <i>='The calculated mass is: ' + ((Math.PI * (229/2)**2) * 10/1000 * 1.18).toFixed(1)+'kg. The calulated rock volume is: '+(5.5 * 6.5 * 14)+ 'm3. The calculated powder factor is: '+(((Math.PI * (229/2)**2) * 10/1000 * 1.18) / (5.5 * 6.5 * 14)).toFixed(2)+'kg/m3'</i>
                        <br><br><b>Known Bug:</b> The text field cannot handle commas at this stage "Error" may result if you use them. When raising a number to a power use the "**" operator. Not the "^" operator or the Math.pow() function.
                        Even a simple string like "Hello, how are you?" will cause the string to be cut off at the comma. This is a known issue and will be fixed in a future release.
                        In order to correct this issue the text field will require serialization and deserialization of the text field. This is a complex task and will take some time to implement. Untill then use a "-" Or "." instead of a comma.
